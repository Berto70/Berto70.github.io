<p> Since I'm just a poor MSc student I don't have any scientific pubblications to show you :pensive: </p>
<p> Anyway I can proudly show you my Bachelor's thesis! </p>

<h4><i>Summary:</i><h4>
<p><i>The purpose of this thesis is to describe the DART mission to the Didymos binary asteroid system.
To do this we start with a general description of asteroids and then move on to binary systems, important scientific
targets for studying the formation and evolution of asteroids and shedding light on the evolutionary aspects of
the Solar System itself. The discussion will then shift to the modalities and purposes of the DART mission,
the first mission with the goal of testing a planetary defense system against potentially dangerous bodies. The
system of (65803) Didymos, the target of the DART and Hera missions, will be discussed, discussing its dynamical,
morphological and spectroscopic characteristics. Finally, the first results produced by the observational campaigns,
terrestrial and space-based, that began immediately after the probeâ€™s impact with the asteroid Dimorphos will be
described.</i></p>
